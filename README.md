#  IOPONICS
We all know that Micro Irrigation is a modern method of irrigation by which water is irrigated through drippers, sprinklers, foggers and by other emitters on surface or subsurface of the land.

> Hydroponics means the cultivation of plants in nutrient-enriched water, with or without the mechanical support of an inert medium such as sand, gravel, or perlite.

In the upcoming days** by 2050**, we have to increase the food production by **70% **in order to meet the global need for food. And currently hydroponics is also in use but for the long run it needs more technological inputs to make it even better. That is the reason why we are working on ** IOPONICS** which is the combination of hydroponics with **IOT and AI**. 
We basically want to bring down the tedious job that is related to hydroponics using** IOT and AI **so that we can guide the end user smartly about the condition of the crop using **deep learning**. 

### Technology Stack

###  **HARDWARE**:
   *  **Micro processor :** Control the entire system and fetch the data                         from the sensors and send to firebase.
   * **Ph sensor :** Sense pH of water solution.
   * **Ultra sonic :** Sense the water level.
   * **DHT 11 sensor : **Sense temperature and humidity around the system.
   * **L238D:** To control the water flow by motor speed.
   
###  **SOFTWARE**:
- **Tensorflow**
- **Keras**
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PRODUD OF :sunglasses:
------
*The biggest accomplishment for us was that we learned so many new things in just 2 days.We were able to overcome all the challenges we faced and didn't lose hope even stayed up all night. It was tiring, but fun as well.*
